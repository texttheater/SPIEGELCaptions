SPIEGELCaptions
===============

A Twitterbot parody of German magazine DER SPIEGEL’s image captions. Takes
existing captions and recombines them randomly, making just as much sense.
Live at [@SPIEGELCaptions@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@SPIEGELCaptions).

The `captions.txt` currently in the repository is based on the DER SPIEGEL
archives of issues 22/1996—52/2021 (selected for PDF availability and
quality).
